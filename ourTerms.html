                            <p>We aim to help students and working professionals make better distance and online education decisions. These terms explain how fee payments are handled, what to do in case of delays or errors, and how we work with payment partners.</p>
                            
                            <p class="mb-4">We encourage you to read these points carefully to keep your experience with our platform smooth and transparent.</p>

                            <h3 class="section-title">1. Payment Responsibility</h3>
                            <p>Users are solely responsible for paying all applicable fees (including course, examination, and late fees) directly to the respective universities. We recommend completing the payment well before the deadline shared on the website or by the university.</p>

                            <h3 class="section-title">2. Role of the Payment Gateway</h3>
                            <p>We may offer a link to an external payment gateway to make the process easier. This service lets users pay securely online through authorised banking and card networks. However, the payment gateway is a third-party service. While we facilitate access to it, <strong>SchoolofOnlineLearning.com</strong> is not responsible for how it operates, any delays, or processing failures that may occur. Payments may take up to 1–2 working days to reflect. Users are advised to plan accordingly.</p>

                            <h3 class="section-title">3. Payment Issues</h3>
                            <p>We are not responsible for any issues arising during a payment transaction, such as:</p>
                            <ul class="custom-list">
                                <li><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Failed transactions</li>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Declined authorisations</li>
                                <li><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Technical errors on the payment page</li>

                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="section-title">4. Refund Requests</h3>
                            <p>If a service is affected due to a payment delay or error, you may contact us with a written request and valid proof of payment. Once verified, we will review the request according to our internal refund policy, which is available on the website. All refund decisions are subject to verification.</p>

                            <h3 class="section-title">5. Fraud & Unauthorised Transactions</h3>
                            <p>If you notice a transaction you didn’t make, please report it to us immediately. We will pass the information to the payment gateway provider, who will handle the matter per their rules and policies. <strong>SchoolofOnlineLearning.com</strong> does not take responsibility for losses due to third-party misuse or unauthorised transactions.</p>

                            <h3 class="section-title">6. Technical Failures</h3>
                            <p>We are not liable for any disruption caused by network issues, server errors, or processing delays outside our control or on the payment gateway’s side.</p>

                            <h3 class="section-title">7. Changes to These Terms</h3>
                            <p>These terms may be updated as needed to reflect changes in services or policies. Updates will be posted on this page. Your continued use of the platform means you accept the revised terms.</p>
