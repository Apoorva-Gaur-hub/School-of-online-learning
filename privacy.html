            <p>At <strong>SchoolofOnlineLearning.com</strong>, we help students and working professionals explore trusted distance and online learning options. We work closely with universities approved by the <!--<strong>University Grants Commission (UGC)</strong> and the <strong>Distance Education Bureau (DEB)</strong> to--> ensure our information is accurate and reliable.</p>
            
            <p>Our platform also offers helpful tools and personal guidance so students can compare courses, understand eligibility, and help them decide to choose a university that fits their goals.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">1. What We Do</h3>
            <p>We aim to help students find a suitable distance and online education program. We offer verified information, university comparisons, and one-on-one support to help with admission. However, we are not a university. We do not conduct exams, issue certificates, or provide mark sheets. All academic documents are issued directly by the respective universities.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Student Information</h3>
            <p>When students share their details with us, like their name, contact number, or the course they are interested in, we use this information only to help them choose the best. In some cases, we may share these details with the university that they are interested in strictly for admission or counselling purposes. We do not share student information with anyone outside this process, and we never pass on personal data for advertising or promotional use by unrelated third parties.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">3. Links to Other Websites</h3>
            <p>We may include links to university websites or official portals to help students gather more information. These links are for convenience only; we are not responsible for the content or policies on those external sites.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">4. University Updates</h3>
            <p>Once you share your details with us to enquire about a course or university, you may start receiving important updates from different universities via email. These updates may include admission dates, course details, and other useful alerts to support your decision-making process.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">5. Information Accuracy & Source</h3>
            <p>While we make every effort to ensure the information on our website is accurate and regularly updated, the content, including course details, university information, and visuals, is collected from official and authorised university sources. However, we make no warranties or representations, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or suitability of the information, services, graphics, or any other material on the website.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">6. Policy Updates</h3>
            <p>Our privacy policy and disclaimer may change occasionally to reflect updates in our services or guidelines. Any changes to the policies will be shared on this page. By continuing to use our website, you agree to the updated terms.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-4">7. Need Help?</h3>
